# Please check the parameters, and adjust them according to your circumstance

# Project name
PROJECT: unit_test

# ================== Control of the workflow ==================

## Do you need to do quality control?
QC: no # "yes" or "no"

## Do you need to do trimming?
TRIMMED: no  # "yes" or "no"?

## Which mapping reference do you want to use? Genome or transcriptome?
REFERENCE: genome  # "genome" or "transcriptome"

## Do you want to do Differential Expression Analysis (DEA)?
DEA: yes  # "yes" or "no"

## Do you want to visualize the results of DEA?
VISUALIZE: yes  # "yes" or "no"

# ================== Shared parameters for some or all of the sub-workflows ==================

## key file if the data is stored remotely, otherwise leave it tempty
KEY: 

## the path to fastq files
READSPATH: data/example/fastq_pair

## the meta file describing the experiment settings
METAFILE: configs/metadata.tsv

## is the sequencing paired-end or single-end?
END: pair  # "pair" or "single"

## number of cores you want to allocate to this workflow
NCORE: 28  # Use command "getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN" to check the number of cores/CPU on your machine

## paths for intermediate outputs and final outputs
OUTPUTPATH: data/output/unit_test # intermediate output. do not upload to github
FINALOUTPUT: output/unit_test

# ================== Configuration for Quality Control ==================

## All required params have already been defined in the public params

# ================== Configuration for trimming ==================

## All required params have already been defined in the public params

# ================== Configuration for quantification using transcriptome ==================

## transcriptome file
TRANS: data/example/ref/transcriptome/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.1.1.10M.fa.gz

# ================== Configuration for alignment to genome and feature count ==================

## genome and annotation files
GENOME: data/example/ref/genome/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.1.1.10M.fa
ANNOTATION: data/example/ref/annotation/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.93.1.1.10M.gtf
ATTRIBUTE: gene_id  # the attribute used in annotation file. It's usually "gene_id", but double check that since it may also be "gene", "ID"...

## aligner
ALIGNER: bwa

## tool for feature count
COUNTER: featureCounts  # default is "featureCounts", or you may want to use "htseq-count"

## alignment quality control
alignmentQC: no  # "yes" or "no" to specify whether you want to do alignment QC

# ================== Configuration for DEA ==================

## Do you want to use edgeR or DESeq2 to do DEA?
DEATOOL: edgeR  # "edgeR" or "DESeq2"? DESeq2 is recommended for transcriptome-based and DEA

## Is your experiment designed in a pair-wise way?
PAIR: FALSE  # Is this a pair test or not? ("TRUE" or "FALSE")

## the comparison(s) you want to do. If multiple comparisons, specify each pair (CONTROL & TREAT) in order respectively
CONTROL: ["Untreated"]
TREAT: ["Dexamethasone"]
## length of 'CONTROL' should agree with that of 'TREAT'
## what you fill in there should agree with the "group" column in metadata.tsv

FILTER:
  yesOrNo: FALSE  # Filter out low expressed transcripts/genes or not? (TRUE or FALSE) It's better to be set to TRUE. FALSE is set as default only for testing fake toy data

## If transcriptome was used as mapping reference in the previous quantification step, the following params need to be specifed

## Do you need to do gene-level differential expression analysis?
GENE_LEVEL: TRUE  # TRUE or FALSE. But if you are using De Novo assembly or not using ENSEMBL, FALSE is the only option
## If TRUE, specify the corresponding dataset in ENSEMBL for your interested organism
EnsemblDataSet: hsapiens_gene_ensembl  # search for your dataset in the file EnsemblDataSet_look_up_table.csv 

# ================== Configuration for visualization ==================

## All required params have already been defined in the public params
